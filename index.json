L’apprentissage est souvent considéré comme une tâche statique. Cependant, en conditions réelles, les données évoluent constamment. C’est ce qu’on appelle une dérive conceptuelle. Par exemple, les marchés financiers sont instables : les risques de crédit ne sont pas les mêmes d’une année sur l’autre. Quelles conséquences pour les modèles classiques ? Les modèles standards ont toutes les chances d’échouer, car ils ignorent complètement ce phénomène. Souvent, on développe un modèle et, après l’avoir fait fonctionner une fois, on pense que le travail est terminé. En réalité, il faut toujours évaluer la performance du modèle en production au cours du temps et évaluer s’il est sujet à une dérive.\nQuelles sont les solutions ? Ce phénomène a été largement étudié dans la littérature sur le stream mining, où plusieurs solutions ont été proposées. Dans ce cadre, les modèles s’adaptent au fur et à mesure. En effet, certaines méthodes permettent de détecter automatiquement les changements dans les données en surveillant la performance des modèles. Elles permettent d’indiquer : \u0026ldquo;attention, un changement est en train de s’opérer, il faut réagir maintenant\u0026rdquo;. L’idée est ensuite de créer des modèles qui s’adaptent rapidement aux changements. Par exemple, si une dérive est détectée, on peut rejeter un modèle obsolète et déclencher l’apprentissage d’un nouveau modèle.\nPeut-on utiliser ces techniques quand les données arrivent par cohorte ? Pas directement, car dans ce cas, il faut attendre entre deux acquisitions successives de données. C’est en effet caractéristique de l’approche statique, car sous l’hypothèse de données identiquement distribuées, il est avantageux d’accumuler autant de données que possible. En stream mining, cette phase d’accumulation n’a pas lieu d’être, il n’y a même pas de problématique de stockage car la donnée est exploitée à la volée. De toute façon, pour être réactif et adaptatif, il vaut mieux attendre le moins longtemps possible. Ceci étant dit, des recherches en cours étudient des systèmes hybrides, où une brique statique et une brique adaptative peuvent collaborer.\nQuels sont les outils dédiés à l’apprentissage adaptatif ? Il y a des initiatives comme MOA (Massive Online Analysis), écrit en Java, et scikit-multiflow, écrit en Python. Les deux librairies sont en accès libre et implémentent l’état de l’art des algorithmes adaptatifs en stream mining. Elles ont été développées par des chercheurs mais conçues pour les professionnels. Quelques fournisseurs Cloud proposent également des solutions optimisées pour les flux de données, mais la plupart ignorent le problème de la dérive.\nL’apprentissage adaptatif est-il crucial pour l’intelligence artificielle en production ? Dans l’industrie, on ne peut pas toujours reproduire ce qui se fait ailleurs car ce qui fonctionne bien dans un cas peut ne pas fonctionner dans une autre. La clef est vraiment de comprendre en profondeur la donnée, de travailler par itération, d’essayer différentes techniques. La solution est toujours personnalisée et particulière au problème traité. Si la donnée évolue par nature et est produite en masse, alors l’apprentissage adaptatif est en effet très prometteur. Dans ce contexte, il fournit les meilleurs performances et la gestion de ressources informatiques la plus efficace.\nPourquoi y a-t-il un tel écart entre les pratiques universitaires et industrielles ? Les cycles de développement sont relativement différents. En recherche, il est naturel d’aller toujours plus loin, d’expérimenter et d’échouer. L’industrie est plus prudente, et requiert des solutions non seulement efficaces mais également stables, car les enjeux sont bien plus sensibles. L’industrie utilise ce qui marche dans son contexte et l’adapte à son besoin. Ces deux mondes évoluent dans des directions complémentaires. A n’en pas douter, toute collaboration entre universitaires et industriels est bénéfique pour les deux.\n","date":1571961600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571961600,"objectID":"5d69992fe7ef4a98d576c726c983af69","permalink":"https://jacobmontiel.github.io/post/2019-10-25-interview/","publishdate":"2019-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-10-25-interview/","section":"post","summary":"My interview on the benefits of adaptive learning methods has been published in a white-book by Quantmetry.\nThe white-book, No. 5 \u0026ldquo;AI en production\u0026rdquo;, is free to download here.\n Transcript of the interview (in french)\nQu’est-ce qu’une dérive ?

Such task is bounded by time and human resources, in other words, there is not enough time to inspect all restaurants in one year and there are not enough inspectors to speed up the process.\nDuring 2015, 843 restaurants were inspected only in the Paris region. Each inspected restaurant was awarded a note:\n A: Everything is correct, no issues found [Best]B: Correct with minor issuesC: Major issues that need to be correctedD: Major issues were previously found and were not corrected [Worst]   Given this scenario, one way to optimize the use of resources for the restaurant health inspections is by focusing on those restaurants with higher risk. Since the number of inspectors is limited, a crowdsourcing solution was proposed using information available in platforms like TripAdvisor, where clients write \u0026lsquo;informal\u0026rsquo; reviews of restaurants. The assumption is that informal reviews potentially contain hints of health issues. Given the popularity of services as TripAdvisor, the number of reviewed restaurants is considerably larger than the number of inspected restaurants. TripAdvisor contains reviews for 8x the number of restaurants inspected in 2015 in the Paris Region.\n  In the map, blue dots correspond to inspected restaurants (Ministry of Agriculture) and orange dots correspond to reviewed restaurants (TripAdvisor).\nPredicting health risks from restaurant reviews   The project is composed of four major stages: Restaurants matchingSince the data sets of reviews and inspections were not created by the same entity we needed to merge them, in order to do so, two attributes were used: the restaurant name and the address (franchise restaurants can have the same name but not the same address). The criteria used to match two restaurants was:(fuzzy matching of the restaurant name is above 90)AND(addresses are within the range of 100 meters) Feature extractionReviews were processed in order to find features (words) with high correlation to the task at hand (health issues). The top 60 words were extracted and used to generate boolean features along with statistical features such as variance, average number of reviews, etc. Supervised LearningThe health risk prediction problem is an example of multi-label prediction, using the features extracted from the reviews and the health notes (A-D) from the inspections a supervised learning model was trained. We used tree based algorithms, namely Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. From test results, Gradient Boosting was selected as the best performer with cross-validated mean accuracy of 77.4%. Applying the prediction modelOnce the prediction model was trained, we applied it into the unlabeled data. In other words, the model predicted the health notes for those reviewed restaurants for which an inspection had not been performed.    Model in action. The map shows the locations of the restaurants with reviews from TripAdvisor, colors correspond to the predicted health note (A-D).\n  This map shows the locations of inspected restaurants with the lowest notes (D), blue dots correspond to inspected restaurants while orange dots correspond to the model predictions. The model was able to predict 3 times the number of potential high risk restaurants based on the user reviews. This way the Ministry of Agriculture can efficiently define where to allocate resources and what restaurants/regions should have higher priority.\n","date":1469750400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1469750400,"objectID":"f2d7d16dce6ef77bb9dac6dfd1f61ba0","permalink":"https://jacobmontiel.github.io/post/2016-07-29-paris-innovation/","publishdate":"2016-07-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-07-29-paris-innovation/","section":"post","summary":"I am participating in the 2016 Paris Summer Innovation Fellowship on the Data Science track with the project:\nOptimizing restaurant health inspections through advanced analytics The Ministry of Agriculture, Agri-food, and Forestry of France (Ministère de l\u0026rsquo;Agriculture, de l\u0026rsquo;Agroalimentaire et de la Forêt) regularly inspects businesses serving food to ensure restaurants and other food retail outlets are following safe food handling procedures.
