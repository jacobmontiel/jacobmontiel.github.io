Our paper describing [scikit-multiflow](https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/) has been accepted for publication at the *Journal of Machine Learning Research - Machine Learning Open Source Software* ([JMLR MLOSS](http://www.jmlr.org/mloss/)).

**Abstract:**
Scikit-multiflow is a multi-output/multi-label and stream data mining framework for the Python programming language. Conceived to serve as a platform to encourage democratization of stream learning research, it provides multiple state of the art methods for stream learning, stream generators and evaluators. scikit-multiflow builds upon popular open source frameworks including scikit-learn, MOA and MEKA. Development follows the FOSS principles and quality is enforced by complying with PEP8 guidelines and using continuous integration and automatic testing.
