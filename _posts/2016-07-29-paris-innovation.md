### Optimizing restaurant health inspections through advanced analytics

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The Ministry of Agriculture, Agri-food, and Forestry of France (Ministère de
l'Agriculture, de l'Agroalimentaire et de la Forêt) continuously performs health
inspections of restaurants. Such task is bounded by time and human resources,
in other words, there is not enough time to inspect all restaurants in one year
and there are not enough inspectors to speed up the process.<br />
<br />
During 2015, 9000+ restaurants were inspected only in the Paris region. Each
inspected restaurant was awarded a note:<br />
<br />
A: Everything is correct (Best)<br />
B: Minor issues<br />
C: Major issues that need to be corrected<br />
D: Major issues were previously found and were not corrected (Worst)<br />

Given this scenario, one way to optimize the use of resources for the restaurant
health inspections is by focusing on those restaurants with higher risk.
Since the number of inspectors is limited, it was proposed to make use of
information available in platforms like TripAdvisor, where user perform
'informal' reviews of restaurants, the assumption is that those reviews
potentially contain hints of health issues.
